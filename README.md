# IonicPlaces

When we have to develop a mobile application, in many cases we also need to develop a backoffice to manage the information that is displayed in the mobile app.

The following system is composed by two modules: 
- An Angular backoffice to manage the information that is displayed in the mobile application. Here you can find the [Angular backoffice repository](https://github.com/jlmonteagudo/WebPlaces)
- An Ionic mobile application. This is the Ionic application

You can get more information about this [SAMPLE APP DEVELOPED WITH ANGULAR, IONIC AND FIREBASE](http://www.jlmonteagudo.com/app/places/).

Firebase has been used as backend.

## Running the application

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jlmonteagudo/IonicPlaces`
- Update the Firebase configuration file: `IonicPlaces/src/config/firebase.config.ts`
- Update the Google Maps API KEY in the file: `IonicPlaces/src/index.html`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run application: `ionic serve`

## DEMO
